# My Personal Website

## What is this project?

This website is meant to show off some of the works that I am most proud of. Hopefully after you browse through the website, you will find out more about me as a person and software developer. 

## How this site was built

I used the Jekyll framework that allows you to easily make an attractive, low-maintenance website that you can easily add extra static content when needed. This fits my purpose because I am currently not the best at design and it is quick to get started with. Hopefully, as I learn more about web technologies, I would like to remake my website with React and either Node, or Flask, if applicable.

## Credits

I used the particle theme that is licensed with MIT open source that was created by github user [nrandecker](https://github.com/nrandecker/)
